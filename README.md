 🎯 Objective:
 Simulate a ticket management system where train tickets can be booked, retrieved, updated, 
and canceled using Java Collections.
 Data Structure
 Each ticket is represented as an object with:
 ticketId: Integer (unique ticket number)
 passengerName: String
 source: String (departure city)
 destination: String (arrival city)
 travelDate: String (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  # Tickets are managed using a map-based structure:
  # Type: Map
  # Implementation: HashMap with ticketId as the key
 Functionalities
 🔹Book Ticket
 Create a new ticket record and store it in the map.
 Ensures quick retrieval using ticket ID.
 🔹View Ticket by ID
 Retrieve ticket details using its unique ID.
 Helps in verification or updating later.
 🔹View All Tickets
 Show all booked tickets currently in the system.
 🔹Update Ticket Details
 Modify ticket information like name, source, or destination.
 Based on the ticket ID.
�
�Cancel Ticket
 Remove a booked ticket using its ID.
 Frees up the slot and maintains accuracy.
